             ========================================

		CHANGES IN ebdbNet VERSION 1.2.7-1.2.8

- Removed foreign function calls with character strings 
- Removed metadata from ebdbNet package overview help file


		CHANGES IN ebdbNet VERSION 1.2.6

- Define USE_FC_LEN_T in the C source code and include Rconfig.h 
(to correspond to code produced by compiler gfortran >= 7)
- Pass character length(s) from C to Fortran by defining FCONE and 
including it in the F77_CALL (https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-exts.html#Fortran-character-strings)
- Convert package to use registration (https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Writing-portable-packages) wth new init.c file

		CHANGES IN ebdbNet VERSION 1.2.4-1.2.5

- Fixed small typo in CITATION file, updated imports in NAMESPACE, updated webpage
					
		CHANGES IN ebdbNet VERSION 1.2.3

Changes:
- Fixed small bug in dataFormat and plotting functions. Many thanks to Slemain Bassim for pointing out these bugs!
- Update dependencies to replace igraph0 with igraph.


		CHANGES IN ebdbNet VERSION 1.2.2

Changes:
- Dependencies to the igraph package were switched over to the compatability version igraph0.
- Fixed bug in R code and bug in C code (line 2478) that caused memory crashes when the number of inputs was greater 
  than the number of genes. Many thanks to A. Baeza for pointing out this bug!
- Small changes made to plot.ebdbNet function to allow variable names to be graphed directly and to clarify 
  presentation of results.

		CHANGES IN ebdbNet VERSION 1.2.1

Changes:
- Author and maintainer contact information were updated.
- Citation information was added, as well as a NAMESPACE file.
- Creation of S3 class 'ebdbNet'.
- sumFunc and fdbkFunc have become an internal functions (.sumFunc and .fdbkFunc) with documentation moved to the
  ebdbn-internal documentation page. 
- The function sensitivity has been renamed calcSensSpec, and the function simFunc has been renamed simulateVAR. 
- The zCutoff function has been folded into the ebdbn function, and users may now calculate adjacency matrices
  corresponding to arbitrary significance levels (not just 95%, 99%, and 99.9%).
- The visualize function has been replaced with plot.ebdbNet, and the format of this function has changed slightly.
  In particular, we make use of the igraph function (which ebdbNet now depends on); this function allows
  either interactive or static plotting.

   		CHANGES IN ebdbNet VERSION 1.2

Changes:
- Author and maintainer contact information were updated.
- References to the "Rgraphviz" package in the visualize function have been removed, 
  as this package has been removed from the CRAN repository. In addition, Rgraphviz was
  removed from the Suggests list for packages in the DESCRIPTION file of ebdbNet. 

   		CHANGES IN ebdbNet VERSION 1.1

Changes:
- The licence was changed from "GNU" to "GNU GPL 3 or later".
- Functions data.format and visualize were added to format longitudinal data and graph results, respectively.
- The Rgraphviz library was added to the list of suggested packages.
- Some parts of the documentation were updated.
- Small bugs in the C source code were fixed.
- Code was adjusted to allow the incorporation of arbitrary driving inputs in addition to feedback from 
  previous time points.

Newly added:
- Graphing capabilities using the graphviz package.


		CHANGES in ebdbNet VERSION 1.0
